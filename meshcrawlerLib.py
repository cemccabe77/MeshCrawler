'''
Meshcrawler is an awesome library that allows you to build a 1:1 topology match
between two meshes that don't have the same vertex order.

This is done (in most cases) *without* users specifying any matching vertex points.
It uses some relatively simple heuristics to accomplish this, and they exist mostly
in meshcrawlergen.py

This is the actual matching algorithm. It takes meshes (that provide adjacency
info), and matched ordered pairs, and either returns a set of vertex matches,
or raises an error

	""" Match the topology of two meshes with different vert orders

	Provide a 1:1 vertex index match between two meshes that don't
	necessarily have the same vertex order.
	At minimum, 3 vertex pairs around a single poly are required.

	The algorithm simultaneously performs two different types of
	"grow verts" operations on each mesh and each vertex keeps track
	of where it was grown from, and how.
	New matching verts will be grown from known matching verts in the
	same way.

	Example:
	Starting with two meshes and a "matched" vertex selection on two meshes
	I'm calling M1 and M2

	Say:
	v6 on M1 is an edge away from (v3 ,v5) and a face away from (v3 ,v5,v4)
	v9 on M2 is an edge away from (v13,v2) and a face away from (v13,v2,v6)
	And we know going in that: M1.v3=M2.v13, M1.v5=M2.v2, M1.v4=M2.v6

	Then we can say M1.v6=M2.v9 becaue if we substitute all of our known
	matches, we can see that the two vertices are equivalent

	Args:
		M1: A Mesh object
		M2: A second Mesh object
		vertPairs: A List of 2-Tuples of vertex indices
			that are known matches
		matchedNum: The total number of vertices matched up to this point
		vertNum: The total number of vertices in the mesh, for
			percentageDone purposes. Default: None
		symmetry: Boolean value indicating whether the vertPairs
			are mirrored indices on the same mesh. Default: False
